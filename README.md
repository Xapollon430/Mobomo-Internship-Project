# Mobomo-Internship-Project
This is my first ever project at my internship, the goal was to track my organizations member count and track who comes in, and leaves everyday.I used an S3 bucket to store the data of the users of yesterday to compare them to todays users. Github API was used to get the info of the members in the organization.
